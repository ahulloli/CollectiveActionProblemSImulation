# Nuclear Arms - A Security Dilemma 

This project simulates the Security Dilemma in game theory, where multiple players(countries) choose between two strategies: to defect(build arms) or cooperate(reduce arms).
This simulation explores how individual decisions affect utility and outcomes for other players. 

## Features
Greedy Approach: This runs a simulation where everyone chooses to defect or be "greedy" by selecting the strategy that results in the best utility without considering what strategies the other players will choose.

Random Approach: This simulates a completely random strategy for each player, demonstrating variability in outcomes. 

Utility Calculation Function: Calculated based on predefined constants and the number of players. 

## Simulation Process
> This first iteration is a basic simulation with two approaches, more variables will impact the outcomes in the future. 

The user is prompted to enter the number of players.

The simulation runs two approaches:

* Greedy Approach: Each player evaluates their best option based on current conditions.
  
* Random Approach: Each player randomly decides to cooperate or defect.
  
The results of both approaches are displayed with comparisons, along with total utilities for each.
